Agile Scrum:
the technical officer lays down the following metrics representing critical success factor to measure the benefits of scrum and its
constant improvement across sprints

1. velocity
2. value per sprint
3. Defect density
4. cycle time

the list of Metric along with it's formula are:

value per sprint(throughout) = revenue/value of delivered feature per sprint or release
bug fix - productivity = total no of bug fixed/person month
velocity = number of stories point by the team/sprint
effort variance = ((Actual release effor - estimated release effort)/estimated release effort)*100
cycle time = average time taken for user story from identification to deployment
defect density = total number of defects from sprint review/actual size delivered
residual defect density = total defects raised post UAT or in production/total story point delivered
% rework = effort spend on rework or retest/total effort for sprint
testing effectiveness = valid defect caught from testing / total defects * 100
testing quality = total defects slipped or caught by client / total test cases executed during ST or SIT
total % of test automated = number of test cases automated / total number of test cases
